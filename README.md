# AI4Life: Helping kids with cancer, investing in future

This repo & work is outcome of our teams participation on [Solve with Google The Hackathon](https://inthecloud.withgoogle.com/pmc-hackaton-24/register.html) to use AI to transform your business and work on real-world challenges for the benefit of [The Princess MÃ¡xima Center](https://www.prinsesmaximacentrum.nl/en).

Provide patient diagnosis grounded on RAG (authority sources for cancer data, diagnosis, symptoms and etc ...). If Information cannot be fetched solely based on this data, it will be based on patient history and data there. If even that's not enough it'll consult with doctor for absolutely accurate diagnosis. As we don't want to scare a patient in case results are not cancer related.
 
Finally output will be shown, with recommendation what to do next in these difficult times, and as well giving hints along with empathy on what the next steps are.
